Daytona USA is an arcade racing game developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega in March 1994. Inspired by the popularity of the NASCAR motor racing series in the US, the game has players race stock cars on one of three courses. It was the first arcade game to be released on the Sega Model 2, an arcade system board which was co-developed by GE Aerospace. AM2's Toshihiro Nagoshi (pictured) became the game's director and co-producer. Sega aimed to outperform Namco's Ridge Racer (1993). The developers researched motorsports extensively and mapped Daytona International Speedway. Daytona USA was a critical and commercial success, praised for its graphics, soundtrack and gameplay. A conversion was made for the Sega Saturn in 1995, and was followed by sequels and enhancements for consoles and arcades. good good good good home gone hood hood hood
